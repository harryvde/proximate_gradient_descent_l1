# proximate_gradient_descent_l1
This script provides a class for the minimization of separable functions with l1 constraint using a proximate gradient descent algorithm. It is used to to estimate efficiently the parameters of models with Lasso regularization. The algorithm relies on a simple backtracking line search algorithm and soft threshold function.
